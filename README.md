# Before Start
Clone the branch to your computer (Fork first is recommended).
And then install [Travis-CLI](https://github.com/travis-ci/travis.rb).

Use travis cli to encrypt your info
```shell
$ travis encrypt IMAGE_NAME="<your-dockerhub-repo>/<your-docker-image>"
Please add the following to your .travis.yml file:
  secure: "<encrypted_IMAGE_NAME>"

$ travis encrypt HEROKU_API_KEY="<your-heroku-api-key>"
Please add the following to your .travis.yml file:
  secure: "<encrypted_HEROKU_API_KEY>"

$ travis encrypt DOCKER_USER="<your-dockerhub-username>"
Please add the following to your .travis.yml file:
  secure: "<encrypted_DOCKER_USER>"

$ travis encrypt DOCKER_PASSWORD="<your-dockerhub-password>"
Please add the following to your .travis.yml file:
  secure: "<encrypted_DOCKER_PASSWORD>"

$ travis encrypt TEAM_CHANNEL_URL="<your-TEAMS-channel-url>"
Please add the following to your .travis.yml file:
  secure: "<encrypted_TEAM_CHANNEL_URL>"
```

The env configurations in .travis.yml file need to be replaced with the encrypted info.
```yml
# env:
#   global:
#     secure: IMAGE_NAME
#     secure: HEROKU_API_KEY
#     secure: DOCKER_USER
#     secure: DOCKER_PASS
#     secure: TEAM_CHANNEL_URL

# replace the following configurations
env:
  global:
    secure: <your own encryption>
    secure: ***
    secure: ***
    secure: ***
    secure: ***
